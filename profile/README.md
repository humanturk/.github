# Human AI
*Reinventing Desktop Interaction for the AI Era*

## Our Mission

For 61 years, we've been bound by the same paradigm: point, click, switch between apps, lose context, repeat. The computer mouse, while revolutionary in 1964, has reached the limits of human-computer interaction efficiency.

**Human AI is building the next evolution of desktop computing.**

## The Vision

We're creating a fundamentally new way to interact with your desktop—one where natural language replaces pointing and clicking, where AI orchestrates seamless collaboration between applications, and where your computer truly understands and anticipates your workflow.

### What We're Building

**Natural Language Interface**
- Interact with any application using conversational commands
- No more hunting through menus or remembering keyboard shortcuts
- Direct your computer like you would a skilled assistant

**Cross-App AI Collaboration**
- Multiple applications working together automatically
- Context preserved across your entire workflow
- AI that understands relationships between different tools and data

**Adaptive Intelligence**
- AI that learns your unique work patterns and preferences
- Semi-autonomous assistance that grows more capable over time
- Predictive workflows that anticipate your next actions

## The Future We're Creating

**Today:** Manual app switching, context loss, repetitive clicking
**Tomorrow:** Seamless AI-human collaboration across your entire desktop
**3 Years:** Full desktop autonomy with AI that works alongside you

Imagine telling your computer: *"Take the data from my spreadsheet, create a presentation with the key insights, and schedule a meeting with the stakeholders"* — and watching it happen automatically across Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook.

## Current Focus

We're starting with **cross-app AI collaboration** — enabling our customers to have multiple applications work together intelligently based on natural language commands. This foundation will evolve into the fully autonomous desktop experience of tomorrow.

## Join the Revolution

Desktop computing hasn't seen fundamental innovation in decades. We're changing that.

**For Developers:** Help us build the APIs and integrations that will power the next generation of human-computer interaction.

**For Organizations:** Be among the first to experience productivity gains that seemed impossible just years ago.

**For Visionaries:** Join us in creating a future where technology truly augments human capability.
